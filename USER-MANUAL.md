## How to Create a Profile?

### Overview

Profile is essential part of the universaldot.me application. 

 The Profile is used to enrich the AccountID information with user specific metadata such as personal interests, name, reputation, etc. Each User can create a single user profile per AccountID.

By creating a profile, you are broadcasting to the network your self-assigned username and interests. Anyone is allowed to create a identity.

Furthermore, in the future tasks will be recommended to you based on your interests. For example, if you are interested in web-development we will traverse through all the tasks available in the network and suggest some web-development tasks that are suitable for you. 

### How To ...
To create a profile is very straightforward. 

Just navigate to the Profile tab in the Menu bar and fill out your details. 

See the image bellow as an example.

## How To Create a Task?

### Overview
Users can interact with one another through Tasks.

There are two types of Users who can interact with tasks. We call them Initiators and Volunteers.

* Initiators are people who have the permission to Create and Remove Tasks.
* Volunteers are people who have the permission to Start and Complete Tasks.

Anybody can become an Initiator or Volunteer. In other words, one doesnâ€™t need permission to become an Initiator or Volunteer.

When Tasks are created, there is some associated metadata that shall be defined. This includes the following:

* Task Title
* Task Specification (Defining the Task specification)
* Task Budget (The cost of completion for the Task)
* Task Deadline (The specified time until which the task should be completed)
Furthermore, budget funds are locked in escrow when task is created. Funds are removed from escrow when task is removed.

## How to Create a DAO

### Overview

The DAO organizes People with a common Vision to work on projects. The DAO works as an extension to the Task module since it enables the creation of large projects which collect many tasks.

A visionary user is able to propose a Vision for the future. Within the vision, a specified Roadmap is created that is broken down into tasks. Thus a DAO is a collection of tasks who are undertaken by people that believe in the vision of the Founder.

Users support a Vision by signing a vision document. Signing a vision document enables users to be added to a DAO where they will be able to create/fulfill tasks in support of the overall vision.

For completion of tasks, users are rewarded tokens and increased reputation.

### How To ...

To create your own DAO navigate to the `Organization` tab in the menu and then click on `Own organization`. Here you will be given several action options which include the following

* Create Vision
* Remove Vision
* Create Organization
* Remove Organization
* Add member
* Remove members
* Add task
* Remove task

Clicking on `Create organization` open a modal dialog where you can fill out organizational details.
